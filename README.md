# Memory-Game-in-Python

A Pygame Mini Project

Python is one of the easiest globally used programming languages, and using the pygame modules with it will give you a chance to easily implement many game applications. Pygame is an open free source that you can download later easily. The game we have implemented is a fairly common game. 

Short Explanation of our game:

Flipping tiles game can be played to test our memory. In this, we have a certain even number of tiles, in which each number/figure has a pair. The tiles are facing downwards, and we have to flip them to see them. In a turn, one flips 2 tiles, if the tiles match then they are open. If not they are flipped and placed back in the position. We keep on doing this until all the tiles have been matched and removed. 

To simulate the game in Python, we used the Pygame and random modules.


=> Consists of even number of tiles.

=> Has 4 shapes :        1. Square        2. Diamond       3. Triangle       4.  Circle

=> 4 colours :        1. Blue        2. Green       3. Red       4. Yellow 


We have implemented this memory game for the following benefits:

Memory games exercise the brain, making it more sharp and alert. 
If you play memory games at least thirty minutes every day, your concentration and focusing ability will improve.
Memory games have been shown to help prevent some memory-related illnesses, such as Alzheimer’s disease.
Memory games enhance other brain functions, such as attention level, and reading and reasoning skills.
